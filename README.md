Redmine LDAP Push
=================

The plugin tracks changes affecting users, groups or projects and propagates it simultaneously to a Ldap server. 
This « enslaved » Ldap server can thus be used for authentication purpose (auth. centralization, SSO) while managing 
the user's roles and project memberships with Redmine.
